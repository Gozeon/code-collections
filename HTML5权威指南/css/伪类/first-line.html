	<p>The ::first-line CSS pseudo-element applies styles to the first line of a block-level element. Note that the length of the first line depends on many factors, including the width of the element, the width of the document, and the font size of the text.</p>
	<p>CSS3 introduced the ::first-line notation (with two colons) to distinguish pseudo-classes from pseudo-elements. Browsers also accept :first-line, introduced in CSS2.</p>
